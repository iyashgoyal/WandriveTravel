"Develop a professional, modern travel agency website for my brand 'Wandrivo' using the frameworks, libraries, or technologies you consider optimal for a polished outcome (e.g., options like Next.js, React, Vue for frontend; Node.js, Django for backend are suggestions, but feel free to choose what suits best). The site must feature a fully responsive design compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, delivering a visually stunning, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. Incorporate high-quality animations (e.g., fade-ins, hover effects, parallax scrolling, subtle scroll-triggered transitions) to enhance its premium appeal. Draw design inspiration from the navigation structures, page types, and visual styles of reference websites like holidayfolks.com, go4explore.com, and holidayscrowd.com, emphasizing vibrant colors (e.g., teal, coral, white, with creative accents), clean layouts, bold typography (e.g., sans-serif fonts like Montserrat or Poppins), and high-quality stock images or videos (e.g., from Unsplash, Pexels) to elevate visual impact. Include the following pages, tabs, and features:

Header and Navigation:
Sticky Navigation Bar:
Logo: Place the 'Wandrivo' logo on the left, combining a stylized icon (e.g., a compass, plane, or traveler silhouette) with the brand name in a modern or script font to reflect its adventurous identity.
Primary Menu: Center a horizontal menu with key pages: 'Home,' 'About Us,' 'Travel Packages,' 'Blogs,' 'Special Offers,' 'Contact Us,' and 'User Dashboard.' Include dropdown menus for 'Travel Packages' to list subcategories (see below), inspired by the dropdown structures in holidayfolks.com and holidayscrowd.com.
Right-Side Features: Add a search icon for a site-wide search feature (allowing users to find destinations, packages, or blog posts), a theme toggle (light/dark mode) for accessibility, a clickable phone number with an icon for direct support (e.g., '+1-800-WANDRIVO'), and a user profile icon linking to the User Dashboard, inspired by go4explore.com and holidayscrowd.com.
Secondary Navigation Bar (Optional): Below the primary menu, include a bar with travel package categories (e.g., 'Adventure Trips,' 'Weekend Getaways,' 'Honeymoon Packages') with dropdowns, styled with a contrasting background (e.g., teal or navy) and white text, as seen in go4explore.com.
Mobile Design: On smaller screens, collapse the navigation into a hamburger menu with smooth animations for opening/closing, ensuring seamless responsiveness.
Pages and Features:
Home:
A captivating hero section with a full-width, high-resolution travel image or looping video (e.g., a snowy mountain from holidayscrowd.com, a tropical beach, or a bustling cityscape), overlaid with bold white text like 'Discover Your Next Adventure with Wandrivo' and a prominent call-to-action button (e.g., 'Explore Packages'). Add subtle parallax scrolling for depth.
Below the hero, include a 'Top Destinations' section or sidebar listing popular spots (e.g., 'Maldives,' 'New York,' 'Himalayas,' 'Paris'), inspired by holidayscrowd.com’s destination sidebar, with hover effects for interactivity.
Add an interactive search bar with placeholder text (e.g., 'Search destinations, trips, or keywords…') and optional filters (e.g., travel dates, budget), as seen in holidayscrowd.com.
About Us:
Highlight Wandrivo’s story, mission, values, and expertise with supporting visuals (e.g., team photos, travel-inspired graphics). Include a 'Testimonials' subsection with a carousel or grid of customer reviews, drawing from holidayscrowd.com’s user-focused design, to build trust.
Travel Packages:
A grid showcasing sample trips (e.g., image, title, brief description, price range, duration), static or dynamic as you see fit. Categorize packages with tabs or filters like:
'Domestic Trips' (e.g., 'Beach Getaways,' 'Mountain Escapes'), inspired by holidayfolks.com.
'International Trips' (e.g., 'Europe Adventures,' 'Asia Explorer'), from all three reference sites.
'Group Tours' (e.g., 'Family Trips,' 'Corporate Outings'), seen in holidayfolks.com and holidayscrowd.com.
'Honeymoon Packages' (e.g., 'Romantic Maldives,' 'Santorini Sunsets'), from holidayfolks.com and holidayscrowd.com.
'Weekend Getaways' (e.g., 'City Breaks,' 'Nature Retreats'), from go4explore.com and holidayscrowd.com.
'Adventure Trips' (e.g., 'Hiking Expeditions,' 'Safari Tours'), inspired by go4explore.com.
Add dropdown menus in the navigation bar for these categories, listing subcategories or popular destinations, enhancing navigation depth as seen in all reference sites.
Blogs:
A page with a grid of blog posts (e.g., travel tips, destination guides, user stories) featuring a thumbnail image, title, excerpt, and 'Read More' link. Include a search bar and category filters (e.g., 'Adventure,' 'Culture'), inspired by go4explore.com’s 'Blogs' tab, to engage users and boost SEO.
Special Offers:
A page highlighting discounted packages or seasonal promotions (e.g., 'Winter Sale Live'), styled with vibrant cards, 'Book Now' buttons, and optional countdown timers, inspired by go4explore.com’s promotional banner, to drive conversions.
Contact Us:
A functional form collecting user data (name, email, travel preferences, travel dates, budget range), displaying a success message (e.g., 'Thanks for reaching out! We’ll respond soon.') upon submission. Include a live chat feature or support icon (e.g., headphone icon from holidayscrowd.com) and an optional map embed for Wandrivo’s office location.
User Dashboard:
A page displaying user-submitted inquiry data (e.g., name, email, preferences, submission date) in a clean table or card layout, with filtering options (e.g., by date or destination). Clarify its intent: for users to view their own submissions (e.g., saved trips, past inquiries) or for admin use to manage all inquiries—specify your assumption. Include a 'Saved Destinations' section, inspired by holidayscrowd.com’s user profile icon, for enhanced engagement.
Additional Pages (Optional):
Careers: List job opportunities with a simple application form (name, email, resume), inspired by go4explore.com.
FAQ/Support: Address common questions in an accordion layout with a support contact option, enhancing user support as implied by holidayscrowd.com’s headphone icon.
Key Requirements:
Seamless Responsiveness: Ensure compatibility across all devices with a mobile-first approach. Adjust hero sections and layouts for smaller screens, collapsing navigation into a hamburger menu as needed.
Premium Animations: Implement smooth animations like fade-ins for page transitions, hover effects on buttons and cards (e.g., scale or shadow), parallax scrolling in the hero section, and subtle scroll-triggered reveals for sections.
Backend Functionality: Create a backend system to process contact form submissions, storing user data (name, email, preferences, travel dates, budget) in a database of your choice. Ensure this data is securely accessible in the User Dashboard, with optional user authentication if needed.
Intuitive Navigation: Provide clear visual cues for active pages (e.g., underlines or color changes), dropdown menus for deeper navigation, and a footer with quick links, social media icons, and contact details.
Design Aesthetics: Use a cohesive color scheme (e.g., teal, white, coral, with neutral tones like gray or gold) and modern typography for a polished look. Ensure high contrast for readability (e.g., white text on dark backgrounds).
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature with results on a dedicated page or overlay, inspired by holidayfolks.com and holidayscrowd.com, enhancing user navigation.
Accessibility: Include keyboard navigation, alt text for images, and a theme toggle for user customization, as seen in holidayfolks.com’s sun/moon icon.
Technology Choices: Select tools that deliver a professional outcome, briefly justifying your decisions (e.g., ‘I chose [tool] for its scalability and performance’). Deploy the site on a platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Heroku, Netlify), providing a complete, ready-to-use solution with no further adjustments needed from me, along with a short explanation of the deployment process and access instructions.
